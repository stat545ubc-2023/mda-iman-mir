# mda-project-overview

This repository contains a data analysis deliverable on datasets in the datateachr package. This package contains datasets of apt_buildings, building_permits, cancer_sample, flow_sample, parking_meters, steam_games and vancouver_trees. For my data analysis I chose to investigate the vancouver_trees dataset. 

## Mini Data Analysis Deliverable 1 
The repositrory can be engaged by first downloading the [`datateachr`](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/datateachr) package by typing the following into your **R terminal**: package inorder to gain access of the data sets. The packages can thereafter be loaded using the following code: 

install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("UBC-MDS/datateachr") 

After these packages are ran, the R code written in the mini data analysis deliverable will be able to run! In each code chunk I added comments about each written code to make it easier to understand the steps I went through for my data analysis. I also added bold text for each subsection of questions 1.2, 2.1, 2.2 and task 3 to help readers understand each component. 

## Mini Data Analysis Deliverable 2
The second deliverable can be engaged with my loading the following datasets: 
1. install.packages("datateachr")
2. install.packages("tidyverse")
3. install.packages("broom")

This deliverable did a further analysis of the four main research questions as written in mini data analysis deliverable 1.
